Complex Queries
- Get the names of students and the courses they are enrolled in, along with their grades:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.course_name, g.grade
FROM student s
JOIN grade g ON s.student_id = g.student_id
JOIN section se ON g.section_id = se.section_id
JOIN course c ON se.course_id = c.course_id;

- Retrieve the list of students who have received a grade 'A' in any course:
SELECT DISTINCT s.first_name, s.last_name
FROM student s
JOIN grade g ON s.student_id = g.student_id
WHERE g.grade = 'A';

- Get the number of students enrolled in each course:
SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(g.student_id) AS num_students
FROM course c
JOIN section se ON c.course_id = se.course_id
JOIN grade g ON se.section_id = g.section_id
GROUP BY c.course_name;

- get the lis of courses taught by each tutor along with the number of sections: 
-- Assuming each course has a tutor_id column in the course table
ALTER TABLE course ADD COLUMN tutor_id INT REFERENCES tutor(tutor_id);

SELECT t.first_name, t.last_name, c.course_name, COUNT(se.section_id) AS num_sections
FROM tutor t
JOIN course c ON t.tutor_id = c.tutor_id  -- Linking tutor to course
JOIN section se ON c.course_id = se.course_id
GROUP BY t.first_name, t.last_name, c.course_name;


- Get the list of students and their average grade for each semester:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, se.semester, se.year, AVG(CASE g.grade
                                                             WHEN 'A' THEN 4.0
                                                             WHEN 'B' THEN 3.0
                                                             WHEN 'C' THEN 2.0
                                                             WHEN 'D' THEN 1.0
                                                             WHEN 'F' THEN 0.0
