- Get all orders from a specific store:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE store_id = 1;

Calculation Queries
- Total sales amount for each product:
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(op.qty * p.price) AS total_sales
FROM order_products op
JOIN products p ON op.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;

- Total quantity sold for each product:
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(op.qty) AS total_quantity
FROM order_products op
JOIN products p ON op.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;

Complex Queries
- Get the store with the highest total sales:
SELECT s.store_name, SUM(op.qty * p.price) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN order_products op ON o.order_id = op.order_id
JOIN products p ON op.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN stores s ON o.store_id = s.store_id
GROUP BY s.store_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;

- Get the most frequently ordered product:
SELECT p.product_name, COUNT(op.product_id) AS order_count
FROM order_products op
JOIN products p ON op.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY order_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

- Get the orders and products details for orders placed in a specific month:
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, s.store_name, p.product_name, op.qty, (op.qty * p.price) AS total_price
FROM orders o
JOIN order_products op ON o.order_id = op.order_id
JOIN products p ON op.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN stores s ON o.store_id = s.store_id
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) = 3;  -- March, you could also change it to other month

Join Queries
- Join products and order_products to list all ordered products with their quantities:
SELECT p.product_name, op.qty
FROM order_products op
JOIN products p ON op.product_id = p.product_id;

- Join orders, order_products, and products to get the detailed order information:
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, p.product_name, op.qty, (op.qty * p.price) AS total_price
FROM orders o
JOIN order_products op ON o.order_id = op.order_id
JOIN products p ON op.product_id = p.product_id;

- Join stores, orders, and order_products to get the store name, order date, and ordered products:
SELECT s.store_name, o.order_date, p.product_name, op.qty
FROM stores s
JOIN orders o ON s.store_id = o.store_id
JOIN order_products op ON o.order_id = op.order_id
JOIN products p ON op.product_id = p.product_id;
