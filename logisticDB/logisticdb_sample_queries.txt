- Retrieve All Orders with Customer Details:
SELECT o.OrderID, c.FirstName, c.LastName, o.OrderDate, o.Status
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID;

-  List All Products Ordered by a Specific Customer (e.g., John Doe):
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, p.ProductName AS Ordered_Product, od.Quantity, od.TotalPrice
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE c.FirstName = 'John' AND c.LastName = 'Doe';

- Find total spending of each customer:
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, SUM(od.TotalPrice) AS Total_Spending
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID;

- List orders with total price for each order:
SELECT o.OrderID, SUM(od.TotalPrice) AS Order_Total
FROM Orders o
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY o.OrderID;

- Find the most expensive product ordered:
SELECT p.ProductName, MAX(od.TotalPrice) AS Max_Price
FROM Products p
JOIN OrderDetails od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductName;

- Show products ordered more than once:
SELECT p.ProductName, SUM(od.Quantity) AS Total_Quantity_Ordered
FROM Products p
JOIN OrderDetails od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductName
HAVING SUM(od.Quantity) > 1;

- List customers with orders in a specific month (e.g. July 2023):
SELECT DISTINCT c.FirstName, c.LastName, o.OrderDate
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE o.OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-07-01' AND '2023-07-31';

- Retrieve the details of orders with more than one product:
SELECT o.OrderID, COUNT(od.OrderDetailID) AS Number_of_Products
FROM Orders o
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY o.OrderID
HAVING COUNT(od.OrderDetailID) > 1;

- Calculate the average price of products ordered:
SELECT AVG(od.TotalPrice) AS Average_Order_Price
FROM OrderDetails od;

- Find the most popular product (i.e., Product Ordered The most)
SELECT p.ProductName, SUM(od.Quantity) AS Total_Quantity_Ordered
FROM Products p
JOIN OrderDetails od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY Total_Quantity_Ordered DESC
LIMIT 1;
